# Learning to Pick and Place: End-to-End Imitation Learning with a Moving Target
This project teaches a robot how to pick up an object and place it into a moving box â€” just by watching demonstrations.
Instead of being programmed step-by-step, the robot learns an end-to-end policy that maps what it sees to the actions it should take.

The goal is to make the robot adapt to different positions of the object and box, so it can perform the task smoothly even when things move between runs.
